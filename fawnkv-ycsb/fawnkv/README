Ranges
  - Ranges are of the form (start_key, end_key]
  - Ranges do not include the start_key, if you want to find the interval DB, use the end_key

Current FAWNKV code assumes:
1. there is only one front-end
2. only one virtual node per backend node
3. front-end does not fail
4. assumes only one node can join/fail at a time

These assumptions should to be addressed in fawnkv code before being touted as a usable kv store.

TODOs
A) Node removal
    1) chain set-up
    2) ACK path
B) Border case code for
    1) Num physical nodes < R
    2) R = 1 for normal join (static join works fine).
    3) When virtual nodes not spaced out enough in ring (two virtual nodes on same physical node are neighbors).
