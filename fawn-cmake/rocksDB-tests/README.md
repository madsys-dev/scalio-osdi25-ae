RocksDB version of rFAWN 

Current version of CMakeList.txt will generate compile time error (undefined reference to rocksdb functions)

The same error messages appeared when I compiled the rFAWN.cc under the testRocks directory, and was solved by 
using the current version of Makefile, which are not generated by CMakeList.txt

To rcompile the rocksDB version of rFAWN, I think we could either 
1) combine the CMakeList.txt with testRocks/Makefile to get a new version of CMakeList.txt or Makefile, and use it to compile fawnds.cc
2) build a new fawnds.cc based on the testRocks/rFAWN.cc, since it can be compiled by its Makefile
