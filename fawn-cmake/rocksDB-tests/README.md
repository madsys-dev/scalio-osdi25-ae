RocksDB version of rFAWN 

Current version of ./CMakeList.txt will generate compile time error (undefined reference to rocksdb functions)

The same error messages appeared when I compiled the ./testRocks/rFAWN.cc, and was solved by 
using the ./testRocks/Makefile, which are not generated by ./testRocks/CMakeList.txt

To compile the rocksDB version of rFAWN (./fawnds.cc), I think we could either 
1) combine the ./CMakeList.txt with ./testRocks/Makefile to get a new version of CMakeList.txt or Makefile, and use it to compile ./fawnds.cc
2) build a new ./fawnds.cc based on the ./testRocks/rFAWN.cc, since it can be compiled by ./testRocks/Makefile
