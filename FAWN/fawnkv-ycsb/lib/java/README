To use the java Library, you need to do the following:

thrift -r --gen java ../../fawnkv/fawnkv.thrift

then to compile the client library, type:

ant

Finally, to compile the tester, type:

ant Tester

To run the tester, type:

./FawnKVTester frontendIP frontendPort myIP

(Have not integrated option parsing in java tester yet, this is a TODO).
